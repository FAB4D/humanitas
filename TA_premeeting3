Filtering: 8 files are generated, 4 for Indonesia, 4 for India
categories: geolocated tweets, associated places, containing cities or regions, by keywords)
not parallelized yet

Get UserIDs: Script nearly complete. Needs to be parallelized
solutions:
Run in parallel and use union (use shell) of lists

Getting tweets: separate processes on 8 machines

Define filters for users!
location; > 50 tweets (users? check that out)
different categories of users? (by join date?)

Time Series Data: 
daily data (but not for meat); chose products with most weekly data
weekly data (pretty good meat)

additional data sources:

weather: imd.gov.in
	wunderground.com (does it have a API?); focus on cities with airports

crude oil: 

association rules: orange python framework


detecting seasonal effects:
read CSV to pandas; indexed columns
Problem: want to generate complete timeseries for each index
NA data; counting NAs: 300 different kind of combination (rice, subproduct, cities)
20% NAs => 150

How to choose data?

Fill NAs: functions in pandas, linear interpolation or duplication
