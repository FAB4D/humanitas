(with reply from Twitter dev)

1/ For the REST API (past Tweets), GET search/tweets: search tweets by keyword (required) + geo-location (latitude,longitude,radius - mi/km)
Example:
- keyword: rice
- location: 37.781157,-122.398720,1mi
Link: https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1.1/get/search/tweets

Notes:
- HTTP GET request
- Requests per rate limit window (15 mins): 180/user, 450/app
- Authenticity: OAuth

2/ For the Streaming API (current Tweets, as they happen), POST statuses/filter: location params (latitude1,longitude1, latitude2,longitude2)
Example:
- -122.75,36.8,-121.75,37.8		-- refers to --		San Francisco
