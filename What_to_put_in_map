What to put in Map:

* Tweets/per inhabitant per region
	write a multithreaded script that loads tweets and counts locations
	ONLY a heuristic

* Count by category per regions - simple Shark query

* Prediction:
	Overlay, make regions and major cities clickable (major city in the weekly dataset)
	Weekly -
	Plot wholesale vs retail

	No online-learning
