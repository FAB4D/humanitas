(taken from investopedia.com)\\
An index that measures and tracks the changes in price of goods in the stages before the retail level. Wholesale price indexes (WPIs) report monthly to show the average price changes of goods sold in bulk, and they are a group of the indicators that follow growth in the economy.\par
Although some countries still use the WPIs as a measure of inflation, many countries, including the United States, use the producer price index (PPI) instead.\par
