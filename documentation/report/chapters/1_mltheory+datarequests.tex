\subsection*{Echo State Networks (ESN)}
Echo State Networks are a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) applicable to many domains because unlike other RNNs they are easy to train.

\cite{jaeger_echo_state_RNN}
The third section explains how echo state networks can be trained in a
supervised way. The natural approach here is to adapt only the weights
of network-to-output connections. Essentially, this trains readout functions
which transform the echo state into the desired output signal. Technically,
this amounts to a linear regression task.

\subsubsection*{Echo States}
For our task we need a discrete time neural network which is incidentally also the constraint in which Echo State Networks are defined. The ESN is assumed to have $N$ input units, $K$ internal network units and $L$ output units. Direct connections from input to output units and from output to output units are allowed.
