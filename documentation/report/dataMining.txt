Data Preparation


Suppose you have some sort of census data like the one below:

SSN#    Age     Sex    Married   Num_kids  Income
006     26      M      No        0         25000$
345     54      F      Yes       2         55000$
743     37      M      Yes       1         80000$

What can you do with it? Let's look at each column:

SSN#: this is unique for each entry, there is no sense to look for
association rules involving SSN#, at least not in this data, since
each SSN# appears only once in the whole data. So we can simply ignore
this field for mining purposes.

Age: this attribute can take a variety of values. ARtool cannot handle
such attributes easily, in fact it only considers binary
attributes. We need to discretize this attribute, replacing for
example ages 0-21 with "very young age", 22-35 with "young age", 35-55
with "middle age", etc

Sex: this has two values: "male" and "female", so we could create two
attributes out of it.

Married: again we can create two attributes: "married" and "not
married"

Num_kids: this also has to be discretized, maybe in "no kids", "one
kid", "several kids".

Income: we could also discretize this into "small", "average", and
"high".

The discretization should be made such that it will identify clearly
the ranges that present interest for the person who will do
the mining of this data.

With these changes we could represent the above data in .asc format
as:

1 very young age
2 young age
3 middle age
4 old age
5 male
6 female
7 married
8 not married
9 no kids
10 one kid
11 several kids
12 small income
13 average income
14 high income
