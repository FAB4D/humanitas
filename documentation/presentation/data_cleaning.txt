Draft of presenting "Data cleaning" slide:

In this stage of work, we want to clean up the messy price dataset, and more importantly,
to explore the dataset to find usable materials for analysis and prediction. W use Pandas
to organize and analyze the data. There are 3 steps in this stage.

First, before data cleaning, we have to get a general overview of the dataset by
generating some rough statistics. We found out that the dataset is highly heterogeneous.
For example, for the rice alone.... (see slide)
Moreover, all food commodities have differnet sub-categories and distributed in
different cities, which makes it even harder to summarize or simplify the dataset.

Next, we have to do a lot of data cleaning because the data collecting process is
done by human beings, and so it's full of errors and neglects. We have missing dates,
duplicated dates, and incorrect extreme data points. (see the figure) (data cleaning
process are shown on slide)

Last, we are ready to find out useful stuff out of the dataset. Unfortunately,
we discovered that the dataset is very sparse. For example most of the combinations
of "region, city, sub-category" of rice are missing. Among 174,048 possible series,
we have only got about 3,000 series. So we have come up with 2 possible solutions of
using the price dataset. (read slides)
