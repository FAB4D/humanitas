Good thing: Most products have a single subproduct.
Bad things:
    - for the products with multiple subproducts, data is incomplete (some
      regions have data for one subproduct, some for another)
    - there is missing data even for products with a single subproduct
    - daily rice data shows that there are ~170 subproducts only for rice;
      this means that other products probably also have more subproducts,
      they're just missing from the data


Products with more than one subproduct:
  Coconut      Fish      Gram      Milk      Rice      Salt       Tea Vanaspati

Possible solutions for getting rid of subproducts:
    1) treat them as different products (reasonable)
    2) pick only the most well-represented subproduct
    3) for each product with multiple subproducts, try to predict the price of
        all other subproducts using the price of one subproduct. this would 
        again allow us to reduce things to only one subproduct.
