Staple foods of Indian cuisine include pearl millet (bajra), rice,
whole-wheat flour (atta), and a variety of lentils, especially masoor
(most often red lentils), toor (pigeon pea), urad (black gram), and
moong (mung bean).

Some pulses, such as channa (chickpea), Rajma or
kidney beans, lobiya are very common, especially in the northern
regions. Channa and mung are also processed into flour (besan).

Many Indian dishes are cooked in vegetable oil, but peanut oil is
popular in northern and western India, mustard oil in eastern India,
[13] and coconut oil along the western coast, especially in Kerala.[15]
Gingelly (sesame) oil is common in the south since it imparts a
fragrant nutty aroma.[16] In recent decades, sunflower and soybean oils
have become popular across India.[17] Hydrogenated vegetable oil,
known as Vanaspati ghee, is another popular cooking medium.[18]

Butter-based ghee, or desi ghee, is used frequently. Since India's
prehistory, ghee has been both a staple food and used for ceremonial
purposes, such as fueling holy lamps and funeral pyres.
