* all_commodities_weekly_india_2005-2014.zip -- archive of weekly price data from rpms.dacnet.nic.in. For raw .xls files, see https://www.dropbox.com/sh/xl4o14wpyjpxqee/1cS4CpLmjR
    Data from 2004 and earlier is far from complete, and requires manual fixes to adjust product names (there are none in downloaded .xls files).
    Some weekly data is missing from 2007, because there are unexpected new products (like lots of new types of rice, which don't appear anywhere else).
