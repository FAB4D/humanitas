IMPORTANT: everyone if required to document theoretical aspects of their tasks

* Data collection
    * Twitter
        * Web archive filtering of keywords to see if there's anything of
          value there
          [Gabriel (India), Ching-Chia (Indonesia)]
        * Get user ids of twitter users from India with many tweets
          [Joseph, Stefan helps]
        * storing tweets
          [Duy, contact Joseph and Gabriel]
    * Crawl daily and weekly price data and stocks; sources in data/india/sources.txt
        [Anton, request help where needed]
        - also document shortly what to pay attention to using the gov sites in sources.txt
    * additional data (India+Indonesia): food production, food stocks, weather, Consumer Price Index (CPI), currency exchange rate (w.r.t $), crude oil price 
        [Duy, Julien, Alex]

* Data processing
    * All data sources must be tabular, csv with the columns discussed on
      github
        [Anton, Fabian]
    * Compute statistics and analyze the data to decide what models can work
        [Stefan]

* Prediction model
    * detecting seasonal effects (TM analysis)
        [Ching-Chia]
    * Choosing input params (how to relate series):
        Price transmission analysis, Association rule learning
        [Alex, Gabriel]
    * FF neural networks and Echo-state neural networks
        [Fabian, Stefan]
    * Support Vector Regression
        [Julien]
