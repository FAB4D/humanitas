update 22.04.2014:

IMPORTANT: everyone is required to document theoretical aspects of their tasks

* Data collection
    * Twitter
        * Web archive filtering of keywords to see if there's anything of
          value there
          [Gabriel, Ching-Chia (Indonesia)]
            -- ready
        * distribution of tasks to azure nodes
          [Gabriel, Joseph (use/adapt for user id download)]
            -- ready
        * set up and write driver for cassandra with spark
          [Gabriel]
            -- ready
        * db scheme for cassandra
          [Fabian, Gabriel helps]
            -- ready
        * clustering of tweets
          [Gabriel, Fabian]
        * Get user ids of twitter users from India with many tweets
          [Joseph, Stefan&Gabriel helps]
            -- ready
        * storing tweets
          [Duy, contact Joseph and Gabriel]
            -- implementation nearly ready

    * Crawl daily and weekly price data and stocks; sources in data/india/sources.txt
        [Anton, request help where needed]
        -- also document shortly what to pay attention to using the gov sites in sources.txt

    * additional data (India+Indonesia): food production, food stocks, weather, Consumer Price Index (CPI), currency exchange rate (w.r.t $), crude oil price 
        [Duy, Alex]

* Data processing
    * All data sources must be tabular, csv with the columns discussed on
      github
        [Anton]
        -- Anton will try to fix the weekly data problem next week

    * Compute statistics and analyze the data to have more information on
      which models can work
        [Ching-Chia, Stefan]
        -- mostly done

    * Interpolate the missing values in each (R,C,P,SP) time-series
        [Ching-Chia]

    * Run PCA (or aggregate with averages) the (R,C,P,SP) time-series into
      (R,P) time-series
        [Ching-Chia, Stefan helps]

* Prediction model
    * detecting seasonal effects (TM analysis)
        [Ching-Chia]

    * Choosing input params (how to relate series):
        Price transmission analysis, Association rule learning
        [Alex]

    * FF neural networks
        [Fabian, Stefan]
        -- use pybrain to implement, train and test the model at
            models/ffnn/model?.txt
        -- high priority
        [Fabian, Stefan]

    * Echo-state neural networks
        -- implement, train and test the model at
            models/esnn/model?.txt
        -- lower priority
        [Fabian, Stefan]

    * Support Vector Regression
        [Gabriel]
        -- train and test the model at models/svr/model1.txt
        -- lower priority

* Maps, visualizations, displaying the data and results
    [Duy, Fabian]
