update 28.04.2014:

IMPORTANT: everyone is required to document theoretical aspects of their tasks

* Data collection
    * Twitter
        * Web archive filtering of keywords and region detection to see
          if there's anything of value there
          [Gabriel, Ching-Chia (Indonesia keywords)]
            -- ready
        * distribution of tasks to azure nodes
          [Gabriel, Joseph (use/adapt for user id download)]
            -- ready
        * write simple script for inserting tweets into cassandra
          [Gabriel]
            -- ready
        * setup Spark, Shark, Cassandra cluster
          [Gabriel]
            -- ready
        * db scheme for cassandra
          [Gabriel, Anton, Fabian]
            -- ready
        * Get user ids of twitter users from India with many tweets
          [Joseph, Stefan&Gabriel helps]
            -- >100k users ready, still runnin
        * Download tweets from previously fetched users
            [Joseph]
            -- > approx. 180M tweets downloaded
        * storing features of filtered tweets in Cassandra
          [Gabriel, Anton, Fabian]
            -- reday
        * storing tweets with MongoDB
          [Duy, contact Joseph and Gabriel]

    * Crawl daily and weekly price data and stocks; sources in data/india/sources.txt
        [Anton, request help where needed]
        IMPORTANT: fetch daily retail data from http://fcainfoweb.nic.in/PMSver2/Reports/Report_Menu_web.aspx and write to csv so it can be processed
        -- also document shortly what to pay attention to using the gov sites in sources.txt

    * additional data (India+Indonesia): food production, food stocks, weather, Consumer Price Index (CPI), currency exchange rate (w.r.t $), crude oil price 
        [Alex, Joseph, Duy]
        IMPORTANT: 
        - Joseph scrape Indian weather data history from TuTiempo.net, data is located in html tables (Duy helps)
        - Alex: analyze food production against prices before 2011


* Twitter analysis
    - Categories for Tweets
        [Anton, Gabriel, Fabian] 
    - Normalize tweet indicators and write template query
        [Gabriel]

* Data processing
    * All data sources must be tabular, csv with the columns discussed on
      github
        [Anton]
        -- Anton will try to fix the weekly data problem next week

    * Compute statistics and analyze the data to have more information on
      which models can work
        [Ching-Chia, Stefan]
        -- mostly done

    * Interpolate the missing values in each (R,C,P,SP) time-series
        [Ching-Chia]
        done

    * Run PCA (or aggregate with averages) the (R,C,P,SP) time-series into
      (R,P) time-series
        TODO
        [Ching-Chia, Stefan helps]


* Prediction model
    * detecting seasonal effects (TM analysis)
        [Ching-Chia]
        *closed* - leaves this to be detected by neural network

    * Choosing input params (how to relate series):
        Price transmission analysis, Association rule learning
        [Alex, Fabian]
        IMPORTANT: we need to do more work on this part

    * FF neural networks
        [Fabian, Stefan]
        -- use pybrain to implement, train and test the model at
            models/ffnn/model?.txt
        -- high priority
        [Fabian, Stefan]

    * Echo-state neural networks
        -- implemented
        -- train and test the model with and without twitter indicators
        -- add weather data and oil price as additional input
        -- teacher force network on commodity price time series
        -- high priority
        [Fabian, Stefan]

    * Support Vector Regression
        -- train and test the model at models/svr/model1.txt
        -- very low priority

* Maps, visualizations, displaying the data and results
    [Duy, Fabian]
    TODO: put map on server, connect to cassandra, style it
    FINAL RESULT: predictions and twitter data interactively accessible through map



* Documentation: 
    * Data collection & processing
